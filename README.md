# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

The ames data set contains the following variables followed by what we
expect the range of each to be:

- parcel id
- Address
- Style
- Occupancy
- Sale Date (1900-2025)
- Sale Price (0-2.5M)
- Multi Sale
- Year Built (1900-2025)
- Acres (0-5)
- Square Feet (0-10,000)
- Bedrooms (0-5)
- Finished Basement SF (0-700)
- Lot Area SF (0-100,000)
- AC (Yes/No)
- Fireplace (Yes/No)
- Neighborhood

2.  The variable of special interest or focus is Sale Price.

3.  Range of the variable, histogram, and general pattern.

``` r
range(ames$`Sale Price`, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1]        0 20500000

``` r

    ## Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.2

``` r

  ggtitle("Sale Price Histogram")
```

Devonâ€™s Work:

After removing an outlier with the value 0, the distribution of Year
built seems to increase as the years become more current. There are
various peaks and valleys.

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(year, aes(y = log(get("Sale Price")), x = YearBuilt)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Sale Price Histogram")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

There does not appear to be a relationship between YearBuilt and Sale
Price. The sale prices of homes seems to be relatively constant across
years that homes were built.However, this graph shows that some of the
lowest sale prices were houses built around the time of the 2008 housing
crisis.
